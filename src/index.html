           <h2>About</h2>
           <p>I’m a motivated and results-driven Data Scientist with a strong foundation in data science and software development.
               As a Information Technology (Systems Development) graduate from WeThinkCode_,
               I gained hands-on experience in programming languages such as Python, Java, and SQL.
               <br>
               My journey into data science was further solidified through a Certificate in Data Science,
               where I developed practical skills in data management, statistical analysis, and analytical programming.
               I’m passionate about uncovering insights through data and using technology to solve real-world business problems.
               <br>
               With a blend of analytical thinking and software engineering principles,
               I create innovative, data-driven solutions that create meaningful impact.</p>
